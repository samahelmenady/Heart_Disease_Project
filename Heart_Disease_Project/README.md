# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, PCA, supervised and unsupervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`heart_disease.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for each step.
- `models/`: Saved models (`final_model.pkl`).
- `results/evaluation/`: Visualizations and evaluation metrics.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
